Welcome to Passio! This Agreement is Passio’s Terms of Service (“Terms of Service” or “Terms of Use”) and it covers your use of Passio’s websites, including www.passiolife.com (“Site”), demonstration applications (“Applications”), SDKs (“SDK” or “SDKs”), APIs (“API” or “APIs”), user accounts created by you to access Passio’s Services, documentation, any other software owned or developed by Passio, updates, upgrades, technical support and anything else made available to you by Passio (collectively, “Service” or “Services”).

By accessing or using the Service, you signify that you have read, understood and agree to be bound by these Terms of Service and to the collection and use of your information as set forth in this Agreement and in Passio’s Privacy Policy, regardless of whether or not you are a registered user.  If you have any questions, comments, or concerns regarding these terms or the Services, please contact us at support@passiolife.com.

These Terms of Use are a binding contract between you and Passio. You must agree to and accept all of the Terms, or you don’t have the right to use the Services.  Your using the Services in any way means that you agree to all of these Terms of Use, and these Terms of Use will remain in effect while you use the Services.  These Terms of Use include the provisions in this document, as well as those in the Privacy Policy.

Will these Terms ever change?

We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so these Terms may need to change along with the Services.  We reserve the right to change the Terms at any time, but if we do, we will bring it to your attention by placing a notice on the www.passiolife.com website, or by sending you an email, and/or by some other means.

If you don’t agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them; unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the Services.  If you use the Services in any way after a change to the Terms is effective, that means you agree to all of the changes.

Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by both you and us.

What about my privacy?

The Company takes the privacy of its users very seriously.  For the current Privacy Policy, please click here: https://www.passiolife.com/privacy.

Our Services are not directed to children younger than the age of 13, and access and use of our Services is offered only to users 13 years of age or older. If you are not 13 years old or older, your cannot use the Service.   If we learn we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.

If you’re agreeing to these Terms on behalf of an organization or entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to agree to these Terms on that organization or entity’s behalf and bind them to these Terms (in which case, the references to “you” and “your” in these Terms, except for in this sentence, refer to that organization or entity).

You will only use the Services for your own internal, non-commercial use to gather information about Company and Company's present and future products as well as to evaluate Company’s technology and products as permitted by the features of the Service.

However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat our security measures or use your personal information for improper purposes.

What are my rights in using www.passiolife.com and Passio’s Services?

The materials displayed or available on or through the Services, including, but not limited to, text, graphics, data, articles, photos, images, illustrations, User Submissions, and so forth (all of the foregoing, the “Content”) are protected by copyright and/or other intellectual property laws.  You promise to abide by all copyright notices, trademark rules, information, and restrictions contained in any Content you access through the Services, and you won’t use, copy, reproduce, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, transmit, distribute, perform, upload, display, license, sell or otherwise exploit for any purpose any Content not owned by you, (i) without the prior consent of the owner of that Content or (ii) in a way that violates someone else’s (including Passio Inc.’s) rights.

You acknowledge that this Agreement grants your rights to use Passio’s APIs, SDKs, and other software developed and owned by Passio for evaluation, information and testing purposes only and does not allow you to use Passio’s APIs, SDKs, and other software developed and owned by Passio in commercial applications. Any commercial use of the Service is prohibited under this agreement and requires a separate agreement between you and Company.

The Services may allow you to copy or download certain Content; please remember that just because this functionality exists, doesn’t mean that all the restrictions above don’t apply – they do!

Do I have to grant any licenses to Company or to other users?

Anything you post, upload, share, store, or otherwise provide through the Services is your User Submission (“User Submission” or “User Submissions”).  Please note that in order to use the Service you grant Company certain licenses and that all of the following licenses are subject to our Privacy Policy (https://www.passiolife.com/privacy) to the extent they relate to User Submissions that may also contain your personally-identifiable information.

For all User Submissions, you hereby grant Company a license to translate, modify and reproduce and otherwise act with respect to such User Submissions, in each case to enable us to operate the Services, as described in more detail below. Furthermore you grant Company a license to use User Submission for the purposes of improving the Service, such as for training Company’s machine learning systems. This is a license only – your ownership in User Submissions is not affected.

If you store a User Submission in your own personal Company account, in a manner that is not viewable by any other user except you (a “Personal User Submission”), you grant Company the license above, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Personal User Submission for the sole purpose of making that Personal User Submission accessible to you and providing the Services necessary to do so.

If you share a User Submission only in a manner that only certain specified users can view (for example, a private message to one or more other users)(a “Limited Audience User Submission”), then you grant Company the licenses above, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Limited Audience User Submission for the sole purpose of making that Limited Audience User Submission accessible to such other specified users, and providing the Services necessary to do so.  Also, you grant such other specified users a license to access that Limited Audience User Submission, and to use and exercise all rights in it, as permitted by the functionality of the Services.

If you share a User Submission publicly on the Services and/or in a manner that more than just you or certain specified users can view, or if you provide us (in a direct email, survey form or otherwise) with any feedback, suggestions, improvements, enhancements, and/or feature requests relating to the Services (“Public User Submission”), then you grant Company the licenses above, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Public User Submission for the purpose of making that Public User Submission accessible to all Company users and providing the Services necessary to do so, as well as all other rights necessary to use and exercise all rights in that Public User Submission in connection with the Services and/or otherwise in connection with Company’s business for any purpose.  Also, you grant all other users of the Services a license to access that Public User Submission, and to use and exercise all rights in it, as permitted by the functionality of the Services.

You agree that the licenses you grant are royalty-free, perpetual, sub-licensable, irrevocable, transferable and worldwide, provided that when you delete your Company account, we will stop displaying your User Submissions to other users (if applicable), but you understand and agree that it may not be possible to completely delete that content from Company’s records, and that your User Submissions may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent that they were copied or stored by other users.

You acknowledge that any images and voice samples you upload via Service (including Applications, SDKs and Site) are subject to the preceding paragraph and that Company is likely to use the images and videos collected from you in training and improving Company’s computer vision and recognition technology. You further acknowledge that any content you upload and share through the Service may be used for improving Company’s technology, including the use of your Use Submissions for training neural networks.

If you delete User Submissions from the Service, Passio will use reasonable efforts to remove it from our Services and backend systems, however, in many cases such removal may not be possible. You acknowledge that cached information, references to the Content or backups automatically created by Company’s cloud services provider (currently Google Cloud Platform) may not be made immediately unavailable.

Passio reserves the right (though not the obligation) to delete any User Submissions that, in Passio’s opinion, violates any of the Company policies or is in any way harmful or objectionable. Furthermore, Passio reserves the right to terminate or deny access to and use of our Services to any individual or entity for any reason.

Finally, you understand and agree that Company, in performing the required technical steps to provide the Services to our users (including you), may need to make changes to your User Submissions to conform and adapt those User Submissions to the technical requirements of connection networks, devices, services, or media, and the foregoing licenses include the rights to do so.

What if I see something on the Services that infringes my copyright?

You may have heard of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the “DMCA”), as it relates to online service providers, like Company, being asked to remove material that allegedly violates someone’s copyright.  We respect others’ intellectual property rights, and we reserve the right to delete or disable Content alleged to be infringing, and to terminate the accounts of repeat alleged infringers; to learn how to report potentially infringing content, click here: https://www.passiolife.com/copyright.

Who is responsible for what I see and do on the Services?

Any information or content publicly posted or privately transmitted through the Services is the sole responsibility of the person from whom such content originated, and you access all such information and content at your own risk, and we aren’t liable for any errors or omissions in that information or content or for any damages or loss you might suffer in connection with it.   We cannot control and have no duty to take any action regarding how you may interpret and use the Content or what actions you may take as a result of having been exposed to the Content, and you hereby release us from all liability for you having acquired or not acquired Content through the Services. We can’t guarantee the identity of any users with whom you interact in using the Services and are not responsible for which users gain access to the Services.

You are responsible for all Content you contribute, in any manner, to the Services, and you represent and warrant you have all rights necessary to do so, in the manner in which you contribute it.  You will keep all your registration information accurate and current. You are responsible for all your activity in connection with the Services.

The Services may contain links or connections to third party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by Company. When you access third party websites or use third party services, you accept that there are risks in doing so, and that Company is not responsible for such risks.  We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Services and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each third party website or service that you visit or utilize.

Company has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, accuracy, privacy policies, or practices of or opinions expressed in any third party websites or by any third party that you interact with through the Services. In addition, Company will not and cannot monitor, verify, censor or edit the content of any third party site or service. By using the Services, you release and hold us harmless from any and all liability arising from your use of any third party website or service.

If there is a dispute between participants on this site, or between users and any third party, you agree that Company is under no obligation to become involved. In the event that you have a dispute with one or more other users, you release Company, its officers, employees, agents, and successors from claims, demands, and damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or our Services. If you are a California resident, you shall and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor."



Will Company ever change the Services?

We’re always trying to improve the Services, so they may change over time.  We may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services.  We’ll try to give you notice when we make a material change to the Services that would adversely affect you, but this isn’t always practical. Similarly, we reserve the right to remove any Content from the Services at any time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, if someone alleges you contributed that Content in violation of these Terms), in our sole discretion, and without notice.

Do the Services cost anything?

The Company Services covered under this Agreement are currently free, but we reserve the right to charge for certain or all Services in the future.  We will notify you before any Services you are then using begin carrying a fee, and if you wish to continue using such Services, you must pay all applicable fees for such Services. All commercial uses of the Services require a separate Agreement between you and Company.

What if I want to stop using the Service?

You’re free to do that at any time, by contacting us at support@passiolife.com. Please refer to our Privacy Policy, as well as the licenses above, to understand how we treat information you provide to us after you have stopped using our Services.

Company is also free to terminate (or suspend access to) your use of the Services or your account, for any reason in our discretion, including your breach of these Terms.   Company has the sole right to decide whether you are in violation of any of the restrictions set forth in these Terms.

Provisions that, by their nature, should survive termination of these Terms shall survive termination.  By way of example, all of the following will survive termination: any obligation you have to pay us or indemnify us, any limitations on our liability, any terms regarding ownership or intellectual property rights, and terms regarding disputes between us.



I use the Applications available via the Apple’s TestFlight – should I know anything about that?
